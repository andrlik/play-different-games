# Play Different Games

A discovery engine for TTRPGs.

This will be a catalog of games, systems, publishers, and authors. The goal will be to highlight the wide variety of games and designers and help people find their next TTRPG to fall in love with.

This is pre-release and not suitable for basically anyone yet.
